        <h1>Welcome to your first Javelin game!</h1>
      </div>
      <br />
      <p><b>Hello {first_name},</b></p>
      <br />
      <p>We are so excited to have you come out to your first Javelin game!</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Attending a Javelin game isn’t just about playing high quality games
        with amazing people. It’s about building lasting friendships with other
        players.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>There are a few things you should know before you play.</p>
      <br />
      <h5>Skill Levels</h5>
      <br />
      <p>
        Javelin has 5 different skill levels that players can play at, Beginner,
        Novice, Intermediate, Advanced, and Expert. We encourage our players to
        get familiar with what each skill level means.
        <br />
        View the difference between all the skill levels at:
        <b><a href="">www.javelinsportsinc.com/skill-level</a></b>
      </p>
      <br />
      <h5>Cancellation Policy</h5>
      <br />
      <p>
        If a game does not have 8 players signed up 2 hours before the game's
        start time, the game will be cancelled. Players who signed up will not
        be charged. You can cancel your attendance up to 4 hours before a game's
        start time without being charged. You can add your friends who are not
        on Javelin on the checkout page by adding a guest.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Enjoy the game!</p>
